Eighteen Years

Eighteen years, for a child,
has she grown up?
 
The day entering into you,
walking blindly along the blurred way.
In the vigorous vitality of yours,
I am a bee with infinite happiness.
Every day is so hopeful and nice,
with the sweet expecting for gain.
 
Grow up with the time elapsing,
a little hurry and exciting.
In your record,
it's my immature and persistent.
 
The busy days are speeding and speeding,
I'm transferring in cities further and further.
While you change,
I'm puzzled in the bewildering world.
 
In a morning,
staring at alien you,
I see some I have not seen,
looks like that day is the start for the growing.
 
Reading quietly,
what do I have except you?
Brighter and brighter……
still love you from heart,
accompany or leave,
the future is still far,  long and very nice.
 
Eighteen years, if it's for a child,
she has grown up.
